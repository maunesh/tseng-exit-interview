                </p>
                <p style="margin-left:36pt"> The goal of this pilot exit interview was to assess the student’s learning experience for the Master of Public Policy (MPP) degree program at the Tseng College.  This effort also sought to provide data on areas to improve.  The evaluation was conducted over a two-week period ending on October 12, 2012.  There were 14 individuals asked to participate in the evaluation with the option to complete an online survey created in SurveyMonkey or participate in a telephone interview, six participants completed an online survey, while two individuals were interviewed via telephone conversation.  The interview protocols were created for both formats, but in both instances the same questions were asked (see attached.)  The effort produced a 57% participation rate.  All subjects voluntarily participated. </p>

                <span style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:12pt">These responses ran the gamut from stating “there 
                    was more interaction with the professors” from an individual with 
                    a first-time online experience to stating that the instructors “failed

                    comments suggest that the faculty member was key to their experience.  
                    The forums for the econ class were engaging because the instructor was 
                    active in discussions, more so than in other experiences.  Another 
                    student felt that the program was one directional and that students 
                    lost interaction both with their cohort members and the instructor.</span>

                    to faculty and staff either went unanswered or were very tardy.  
                    Another enjoyed the program but had significant comments regarding displeasure 
                    with the culminating experience and the end result.  Yet another 
                    notation was that the experience was “adequate.”  This group 
                    had a wider spread of positive or negative responses.</span>
